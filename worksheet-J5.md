# Worksheet J5 - GUIs

## 1.) How does object-oriented programming pair so closely with GUIs?

In the 1990's, as others were starting to use computers at home and using programmigns, JAVA and GUIs were on the rise, and GUIs allow people to use programs without knowing the insides. This relates to information hiding and abstracting things away, which OOP does. 
(JAVA swing library provides and API to seamlessley use GUIs.)

## 2.) What is the relationship between `WindowListener` and `WindowAdapter`?



## 3.) What does the program below produce for a GUI? (You can sketch and upload an image or describe it – do this without running the program to make sure you understand what each line below is doing).



## 4.) Modify the `HelloGoodbyeEx2` code to update the number of times the button has been clicked on the button’s label itself.



## 5.) Consider the following Java swing GUI. Convert the `ActionListeners` to Lambda Functions.



## 6.) Explain why for `ActionListener` you can use a Lambda function but for `WindowListener` you cannot?



## 7.) Write a program that allows you to enter a 6-digit PIN, like you would on your smartphone to unlock it. It should have the following layout: Where `[ < ]` is a “backspace” button. The display should show the PIN as it is typed, and when the user enters the PIN 202113, the display changes to “YOU MAY ENTER!”
